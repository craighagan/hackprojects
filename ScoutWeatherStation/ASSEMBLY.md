## Assembly

### Connect wires between sensor and display

Place short red wire in pin g-30 and e-27
Place short black wire in pin g-29 and e-26
Place short yellow wire in pin g-28 and e-28
Place short green wire in pin g-27 and e-29

### Connect wires between sensor and arduino
Place long red wire in pin h-30 and g-10
Place long black wire in pin h-29 and g-8

### Install Arduino
It should have four pins connecting between f-10 and f-7 (purple line)

### Install Arduino wires
Connect arduino yellow wire to pin h-28
Connect arduino green wire to pin h-27

### Install Sensor (BME280)

Place the sensor in row j, pins 25-30, with "VCC" in pin 30. (should be along pink line).
SDA should line up with green wire, SCL with yellow wire, VCC with red, GND with black

### Install Display

Place the display in row d pins 26-29. SDA should line up with green wire, SCL with yellow wire, VCC with red, GND with black

### Connect power terminal to battery pack wires

With the legs facing up, the black wire is on the left, red wire on the right

### Connect power terminal to breadboard

The red leg should be in pin j-10 and the black in j-8

### Turn on power
