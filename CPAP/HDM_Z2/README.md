# HDM Z2 Auto

I like to hike and camp, but have sleep apnea. Since I find I'm much better if I get a full night's sleep, I purchased a system that I could travel with and use a standard phone power bank to run. I'm fortunate in that my settings are only about 5cmH2O, so I don't use that much power.

My machine is an [HDM Z2 Auto](https://breas.us/products/cpaps-for-travel/z2-auto/),
I've made three power cables for it. I've used multiple power banks with it:
1. A 114Wh (30,000mAh) [Baseus battery pack](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08JV4W4NY), it uses about 25% per night (7.5hrs) with my settings
1. A 97Wh (20,000mAh) [Omnicharge Omni20](https://www.omnicharge.co/products/omni-20/)) is about 40% used after an 7.5hr night
1. A 297Wh (80000mAh) [EnginStar Portable Power Station](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WQN41V9) with a [65w car USB-C adapter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08QZ7RTSW)
1. A (26800mAh) [Anker Astro E7](https://www.anker.com/ca/products/variant/astro-e7-26800mah-portable-charger/A1210012)
1. A (266wH) [Renogy 266whH Battery](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0791WDZTW)

My favorite is the omnicharge 20, but that is big for backpacking, the baseus has more capacity for similar weight, so I use it most. It gives me two nights with between 20-33% capacity remaining depending upon conditions. A catch is that it can't run CPAP and charge phone at the same time unless both request the same voltage due to how the device regulates power. I'm testing the Renogy now, intending upon using it for an extended trip away from power. 

The EnginStar, Renogy, and OmniCharge can both hook up to a solar cell for recharging. The Omnicharge can't provide USB-C power while charging via solar (it can provide USB-A).


For solar, I have a [50w](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09154L69K) which is waterproof and very rugged and a [100w fair weather cell](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075YRKVMH) I use with my laptop. Note: the 50w cell came with an adapter to standard barrel jack, but had incorrect polarity on the plug, so it didn't work until I fixed it. That cell is great, with that one nit.

## What is in My kit?

1. [HDM Z2 Auto](https://breas.us/products/cpaps-for-travel/z2-auto/)
1. Power Cable, one of:
   1. [USB-C 15v Trigger Cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08NTTK8S9) (see below) I use this the most, it most reliably provides full power to the motor
   1. USB-A with 15v Regulator (see below) This doesn't come unplugged as much as usb-c but the motor seems a touch weaker (may be in my mind)
1. [HDM Z2 muffler](https://www.cpapxchange.com/q-lite-in-line-cpap-bipap-muffler-kit.html) (came with machine)
1. [HDM Z2 Hose Connector](https://www.amazon.com/Replacement-Custom-Adapter-Design-Medical/dp/B07G4HKHX1) (came with machine)
1. One P30i head mask and medium nasal pillow; all is an extra from my Airsense; parts below:
   1. [Medium Nasal Pillow](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07R6B17QS)
   1. [Swivel Elbow Connector](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08H564YLP)
   1. [Headstrap](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P5HPCLR)
   1. [Airfit Std System](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P5FYYL3)
1. [Flexible CPAP Hose](https://www.amazon.com/Premium-Universal-CPAP-Tubing-Hose/dp/B01N4RGZ80)
1. [Humidity Exchanger](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PMNMTTC)
1. [Baseus 45w 114wh Power Bank](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08JV4W4NY)

All of the above fit into a standard one gallon ziptop freezer bag, which I can put into my backpack.

I've been meaning to replace my hose with a smaller [collapsible hose](https://www.amazon.com/INNOTECH-4332594073-TravelHose-Collapsible-CPAP/dp/B01B5DHJ5O), but haven't tried it yet.

## Camping?

I often camp and/or backpack with my family and with scouts (I assist my son's Scoutmaster). In warmer weather, I use a [Warbonnet Blackbird XLC hammock](https://www.warbonnetoutdoors.com/product/blackbird-xlc/), and run hoses over the ridgeline and store the machine in the "shelf", it ends up being more comfortable than my bed at home. In colder weather, I use a tent and things work roughly like at home save that I'm using a different machine. A challenge for backpacking is that I'm starting with about 1.5-2lbs more weight and a gallon of volume filled in my pack.

# Power Cable Options for running the HDM Z2 Auto from a powerbank

## 15V Trigger Cable

| :warning: WARNING: making mistakes, wrong, or faulty parts could damage your CPAP machine! |
| --- |

A USB-C Trigger table connects and produces a fixed, preset voltage if the USB-C charger can supply the requested voltage. This is the easiest way to run an HDM Z2 from a phone power pack, and what I use most often. I've also found that with my power banks, this cable tends to provide the most power the most quickly, so my CPAP has a touch more airflow using this cable than the other options (this may be in my head, so...).

If you use a USB trigger cable make *_SURE_* you get a 15v part and check the specs on your power bank. I tested with a multimeter, and a PD power brick good for 45+w which support 15v output (most that do 20v will do 15v).  That isn't a big deal to me. As with everything, you're not using your CPAP with the expected cables/power, so caveat emptor; be careful, check your final power and polarity many times.

I first made my own cable, then bought [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08NTTK8S9) If you buy the premade, make _SURE_ to test it with a multimeter in case you accidentally received the wrong part.
